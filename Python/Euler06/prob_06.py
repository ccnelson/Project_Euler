#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025
#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
#3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
