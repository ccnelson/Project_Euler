### Notes regarding chosen solutions ###


Problem 01:
Utilisation of inclusion-exclusion principle allows us to avoid looping through and testing every value at least once.
If we test every value from 1 to 999, 999/3 of these will require a single test (using a conditional logical OR operator), 
with the reainder requiring two: 
333 + ( 666 * 2 ) = 1665 division / modulo operations performed. 
The chosen solution requires 0 division / modulo operations (which are computationally expensive) - and instead performs: 
( 999 / 3 ) + ( 999 / 5 ) + ( 999 / 15 ) + ( 2 ) addition and subtration operations. 
333 + 199 + 66 + 2 = 600.

New solution has arithmetic progression formula based on n(n+1)/2 multiplied by increment.
This formula reduces execution time so much that for c++ the timer had to be changed from microseconds to nanoseconds for 
comparison. This formula was tested for positive and negative values and appears to hold up, but I remain tentative 
as have only just started studying mathmatical sequences and series.

Problem 02:
An obvious choice for Fibonacci sequence generation is recursion. 
However, this becomes inefficient as numbers grow exponentially and recursion levels grow deeper.
Instead a simple iterative loop proves more effective.
Again, as modulo is computationally expensive, an alternative is sought.
Most languages allow for bitwise AND tests, which examine a values least significant bit to determine its parity.

Problem 03:
By dividing out all other factors we are left with the largest prime factor.
By treating even numbers seperately we can avoid testing them again.
By setting a square root boundary we can efficiently deal with prime numbers who
will have no other divisors.
