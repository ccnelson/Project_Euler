# Project_Euler
Solutions to Project Euler problems. Various languages.
(https://projecteuler.net/)

Rules:

1. Code must be compiled locally.
2. No IDE. Text editors only.
3. Solutions should be timed.
4. Code should be self contained. No dependencies. No external libraries. 

* Timers used are not always adequate benchmarking techniques, but rather a quick and dirty way to compare solution runtime. 

* Some solutions have alternative versions for comparison named according to their efficiency placing. E.G. Euler01 = 1st, Euler01_b = 2nd.

* Solutions do not always have a consistent placing. For example: the fastest 
solution for Euler01 in C++ does not use the same approach as the fastest 
solution in C#
