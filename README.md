# Project_Euler
Solutions to Project Euler problems. Various languages.

Rules:

1. Code must be compiled locally.
2. No IDE. Text editors only.
3. Solutions should be timed.
4. No external libraries. 

* Timers used are not always adequate benchmarking techniques, but rather a quick and dirty way to compare solution runtime.
